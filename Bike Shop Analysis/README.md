# Bike Shop Data Analysis

## Description

In this project, we will explore the bike shop sales for the past three years and generate valuable analysis that will help the store owner to see the status of the shop and take necessary action based on the information.

This interactive Bike Shop dashboard will provide a fully detailed sales report which will be a big help to make the business grow. The report contains 4 KPIs, different visualization with regards to the revenue, slicer to filter the data based on their needs, and detailed drill-through to see the actual data itself.
